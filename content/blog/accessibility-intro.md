## What is web accessibility?

The word “accessibility” means “_the quality of being able to be reached or entered_”. In the context of the Web, however, accessibility has a more specific meaning.

Web accessibility refers to making websites and applications accessible to people with disabilities. It is about removing barriers to access, so that websites and applications can be accessed and used by everyone.

## Who defines web accessibility?

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (WCAG) is how we measure how accessible our web products are. The standards are created by the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/) (W3C), the same group that defines all our web standards for interactivity, internationalisation, security, mobile computing, and more.

### How do we define and measure web accessibility?

WCAG is measured with three levels of conformance, from A (lowest), AA, to AAA (highest). To measure your website accessibility, you would measure how compliant it is with any of these WCAG levels.

### Principles of accessibility

WCAG state there are [4 Principles of Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-fourprincs-head) that every product should be:

1. **Perceivable** — information needs to be available to at least one sense (sight, hearing, touch)
2. **Operable** — a user must be able to perform all interface actions (i.e., with a keyboard)
3. **Understandable** — a user should understand the language on a page and how to operate it
4. **Robust** — different user agents, including assistive technologies, content should be able to access all content

## How might people interact with a website?

We probably envision someone using a keyboard and mouse when we think about who is using a website. The reality is, people interact with websites in a variety of ways.

### What are the different types of disabilities?

- **Visual —** Blindness, colour blindness, low vision, glaucoma
- **Hearing —** Deafness, hard-of-hearing
- **Motor —** Limited fine-motor control
- **Cognitive —** Difficult focusing, learning disabilities
- **Seizures** - triggered by flashing visual content

### With what tools can people access websites?

Here’s a list of a few popular ways:

- **Keyboard**
  Some people only use a keyboard to navigate. This is common amongst people with motor impairments who cannot operate the fine movements a mouse requires.
- **Screen Readers**
  Assistive technology that reads what’s on the screen, most commonly used by those with blindness or low vision. Usually operated using only a keyboard.
- **Browser Zoom** (ideally support up to 200%)
  People with low vision may use the zoom feature in their browsers to better read text and see imagery.
- **[Custom styling](https://webaim.org/techniques/css/)** People with low vision or colour blindness might have their own custom style sheets to adjust styles like font size and colour
- **[Refreshable braille displays](https://www.afb.org/node/16207/refreshable-braille-displays)**
- **[Magnification software](https://abilitynet.org.uk/factsheets/screen-magnification)**
- **Speech recognition software**
  Speech recognition can be used for dictating text in a form field, as well as navigating to and activating links, buttons, and other controls. Most computers today have built-in speech recognition functionality.
