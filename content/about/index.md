# About me

Hey there, i'm Niamh. I'm a Frontend developer currently working at Sage. I work with HTML, Javascript, and React and i'm interested in how we can build products that are usable and accessible.

I mainly write about the web and accessibility on my blog but I also write about anything I find interesting or insightful.

When i'm not working, I enjoy:

- walking my pitbull
- powerlifting
- cold water swimming
- reading
