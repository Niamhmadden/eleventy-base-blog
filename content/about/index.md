# Niamh Madden

Hey there, i'm Niamh. I'm a Frontend developer currently working at Sage. I work with HTML, Javascript, and React and i'm interested in how we can build products that are usable and accessible.

When i'm not working, I enjoy: walking my pitbull, powerlifting, cold water swimming, reading, and generally enjoying the simple things in life.
